              contracts. So basically they are the boss of it all.

            Hornclaw is our humble attempt to ‘fix’ the glaring and longstanding
            asymmetries rampant in traditional stock markets - information gaps
            and opacity, lack of expertise, and many other such realities -
            which effectively skew success in favour of the wealthy and act as
            entry barriers for the ‘masses’. Signs that a socio-fiscal
            revolution is brewing have been apparent ever since cryptocurrencies
            hit the common consciousness of the young and hungry across the
            globe. The record smashing numbers, the sheer scale of adoption, the
            passionate conversations on social media and in living rooms - all
            pointed to the fact that the world is waiting to disrupt finance as
            we’ve known it for the last few centuries. The aim that we seek to
            achieve with Hornclaw is to bring the worlds of trading and gaming
            together in ways that are easy to understand and risk-efficient.
            Hornclaw - for the people, in the language of the people, and in
            favour of the people.
